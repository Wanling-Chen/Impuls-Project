Politeia How far from us are the sun, Aletheia, and you
If you don’t see her and me/us 
If I don't see you and her/us? 
You’ve been formed inside us, and we sip the Gesit in your womb
Just like Philia, the hard-to-get Philia
 
Oh Politeia
You come from Athens 
From the Athens which has been lost in the history, somewhere far from the arms of the women in love, somewhere far from the fishermen 
far
So far that the windmills of the sixteenth century have gone and the passers-by through this desert and their camel trains have been forgotten.
 
Politeia
You see how amazing your presence is?
I look at where my finger is pointing.  the idiot sees my finger. 
But, I see the moon, I see you, I see where my finger is pointing to / your presence
 
Politeia
 
I have sent my hands far to find you 
To the ashes of my childhood dreams 
To the apprehensions of my buried men and women 
To see you quietly and embrace you 
My hand dried up waiting for you. 
And my eyesight got blurry towards you. 
 
Politeia
I know You’re standing there
towards the side where the moon shines, where the light is; towards the Aletheia, towards the direction of my finger
You are standing there, though far but close.
I know
You’ll begin Athens again in a new land, on a clear horizon,
For freedom, for human, for the holy Techne; "Techne Politeia"
